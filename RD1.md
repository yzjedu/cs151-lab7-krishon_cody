In this lab we were supposed to learn how to loop an defined function an finite amount of times.

We began by developing five different functions for the five different rooms and a main function to develop it all.
After we understood that we should loop one function five times, we worked to refactor the initial code to be utilized in a loop.
We tested our calculations with various test cases making sure that our program works in extreme conditions.

I believed I learned from this lab what I was supposed to and I enjoyed working with my partner.

The objective of this lab was to 
learn how to program using functions. We first discussed
the possible functions we would need to create this code
and then we created a possible algorithm we could use to
program the code. Our results did match what we expected to get
and the various test cases we tried proved to us that our program was accurate.
The first challenge we encountered was at first we made 5 different functions, but then we realized
it would be more effective if we just used 2.
We first designed and planned, then wrote the code, then tested to see if the code worked.
I think I learned what I was supposed to because my understanding on functions has increased. It was nice 
working with Krishon
